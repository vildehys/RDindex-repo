          <br>
          Our history began with a climber and hiker enthusiast, Jon Johnsen. He was spending so much money on gear, because he needed to change is every season. He couldn’t find any good clothes for his hiking that had the quality he waslooking for, unless it too expensive. He wanted to make affordable products, with the quality of the unfordable.Together with two friends, they startet RAINDAYS in 1999 with one shop in Oslo, Norway. One year later they had 5 shops,and now we count 100, going strong, with partners on several e-commerce pages including our own.
          <br>
